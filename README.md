# ServerRemote
Remote controller for your server.
## Usage
`node server.js [config]`

The config file must be a json file. Leave it empty, the content will be generated by the program. 
## Development notes
To run without visual studio use `npm start ../Example/remote.json`, to build without visual studio `npm run build`.
To build only client code run `npm run buildClient`.

To create a release build run `npm run release` this will create a folder `Release` inside the solution folder.
